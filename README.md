# Dewitcher-2
Dewitcher-2 is the next generation of the original dewitcher framework, for use with Cosmos operating systems.

Dewitcher is a very powerful OS framework based on Cosmos

##Important Info:
As this is a work in progress to get the original dewitcher framework to work in the latest generations of Cosmos,  
many features won't work as expected, but with time more and more will work just fine.  
And also because this is built upon the existing dewitcher code there will be some left over coding and documentation so if not relevant do ignore it :)
